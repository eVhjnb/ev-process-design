# Level 2 – Finance Core Processes

This folder contains Level 2 (more detailed) process diagrams for the Finance domain.

Processes included (examples):

- `invoice_to_cash.puml`  
  From contract / usage data to issued invoice, payment collection, and reconciliation.

- `vendor_payments.puml`  
  Vendor / contractor payables, approval workflow, and payment execution.

- `budgeting_cycle.puml`  
  Periodic budgeting, review and update of financial plans.

These diagrams are anonymized and use generic names (ServiceCo, Client, Vendor),
while still reflecting realistic flows derived from actual operations.
